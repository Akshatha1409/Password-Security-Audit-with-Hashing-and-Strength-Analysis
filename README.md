# Password Security Audit Tool

This project demonstrates a simple password security audit by validating password strength and securely hashing it using SHA-256.
This tool highlights common weaknesses and shows how passwords should be stored securely.

## Features
- Password strength validation
- Secure hashing using SHA-256
- Security best-practice recommendations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Regular Expressions
- Cryptographic Hashing

## Sample Output

akshatha2022 - 

Weak Password: 
- Missing upperacse letter
- Missing special characters

 SHA256 Hash:
138a02e9ecb42f3ec1a68ed03cb444fb6426ff2194368489f6ad43226b1e3271

## Future Improvements
- Add bcrypt hashing
- Check against breached password lists
- GUI or web interface
